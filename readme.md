Welcomme to ArduinoHouse project.

This is a smart home/automation system based on Open source/Open hardware and Arduino platform.
It documents topology of my (future) house.

Topology:
- Every switch, light, heater, window blind is wired to a central unit
- CAT5E is used for the datalines/switches
- Powerlines are wired directly to central unit (Gateway/Relay unit)

As central brain a single RaspberriPI is used runnging OpenHAB and Mosquitto as MQTT server. Input/Output gateways are connected using LAN via MQTT.

More to come..
